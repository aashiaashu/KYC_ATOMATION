## KYC Registration System Prototype

## Overview
This project aims to develop a prototype for a KYC (Know Your Customer) registration system using Python and Streamlit. The prototype allows users to provide their personal details through speech input, capture an image of themselves using their webcam, and verify their registration details against predefined data.
## Features
- User-friendly interface for capturing user details through speech input.
- Webcam image capture functionality for capturing user images.
- Verification of user-provided details against predefined data.
- Display of additional information about the KYC process in the sidebar.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV (for webcam image capture)
- SpeechRecognition (for speech input)
- FuzzyWuzzy (for text similarity comparison)
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```
    streamlit run kyc_registration.py
    ```
## Usage
1. Navigate to the Streamlit app URL after running the app.
2. Follow the prompts to provide your personal details through speech input.
3. Capture an image of yourself using the "Capture Image" button.
4. Once all details are provided, the KYC verification process will be completed automatically.
